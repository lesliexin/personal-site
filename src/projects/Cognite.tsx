        <typography.BodyMain>
          Cognite is an enterprise software company that serves customers in
          heavy-asset industries like power & utilities, oil & gas, and
          manufacturing. Their main product offering is Cognite Data Fusion
          (CDF) - software which contextualizes data at scale, enabling
          companies to get access to their data, make sense of it, and then use
          it to make meaningful decisions.

        <typography.Subtitle20>What is AIR?</typography.Subtitle20>
        <typography.BodyMain>
          On top of Cognite Data Fusion sits a handful of business applications,
          one of which is Automatic Identification and Reporting, more commonly
          known as AIR. AIR enables out-of-the-box use of data science models to
          detect and identify abnormal behaviour of equipment sensors.

        <typography.BodyMain>
          When I joined the team, a proof of concept (POC) for AIR had just been
          completed. This POC was built in 3 months and was used to test
          technical feasibility and to gain some initial insight on customer
          interest. However, as the AIR was only in a POC state, the application
          was incredibly slow and had many usability issues. This was because
          this POC was developed using a lightweight prototyping framework with
          little design considerations.

        <typography.BodyMain>
          As AIR was a new project, we didn‚Äôt have a comprehensive understanding
          of our users and their workflows. The best solution to this was to
          talk to our users face-to-face (even if that meant taking a flight ‚úà
          Ô∏èto see them).

        <typography.BodyMain>
          After conducting user research interviews with our end users, we sat
          down with our stakeholders (the manager and VP of our org) to ensure
          that our team was aligned on the definition of success.
