        <typography.Subtitle20>What is Cognite?</typography.Subtitle20>
        <typography.BodyMain>
          Cognite is an enterprise software company that serves customers in
          heavy-asset industries like power & utilities, oil & gas, and
          manufacturing. Their main product offering is Cognite Data Fusion
          (CDF) - software which contextualizes data at scale, enabling
          companies to get access to their data, make sense of it, and then use
          it to make meaningful decisions.

        <typography.Subtitle20>What is AIR?</typography.Subtitle20>
        <typography.BodyMain>
          On top of Cognite Data Fusion sits a handful of business applications,
          one of which is Automatic Identification and Reporting, more commonly
          known as AIR. AIR enables out-of-the-box use of data science models to
          detect and identify abnormal behaviour of equipment sensors.

        <typography.BodyMain>
          When I joined the team, a proof of concept (POC) for AIR had just been
          completed. This POC was built in 3 months and was used to test
          technical feasibility and to gain some initial insight on customer
          interest. However, as the AIR was only in a POC state, the application
          was incredibly slow and had many usability issues. This was because
          this POC was developed using a lightweight prototyping framework with
          little design considerations.

        <typography.BodyMain>
          As AIR was a new project, we didn‚Äôt have a comprehensive understanding
          of our users and their workflows. The best solution to this was to
          talk to our users face-to-face (even if that meant taking a flight{" "}

          Talking to our stakeholders
        </typography.Subtitle20>
        <typography.BodyMain>
          After conducting user research interviews with our end users, we sat
          down with our stakeholders (the manager and VP of our org) to ensure
          that our team was aligned on the definition of success.

        <typography.BodyMain>
          The two primary users of AIR are first line engineers and data
          scientists. To better understand these users, I ran a workshop with
          our team plus a subject matter expert to gain deeper insight. During
          the workshop, we mapped out the pains, gains, and jobs of each user
          persona and then consolidated the main pain points we would focus on.
          From there, persona briefs were created for each primary user, which
          guided the development of more detailed user stories.

          How does AIR fit into Cognite?
        </typography.Subtitle20>
        <typography.BodyMain>
          We then looked at Cognite‚Äôs persona library and discussed the scope of
          AIR with the other business application teams that served the same
          personas. Communication across teams is super important to identify
          how our products potentially overlap and how we can differentiate.
          Additionally, these discussions enabled us to collaborate on similar
          infrastructure elements and reusable frontend components.

          We did a design critique of the exisiting application with our team

          <typography.BodyMain>

            How we made it better:
          </typography.GreySubtile>
          <typography.BodyMain>
            ‚Ä¢ Grouped important information under common parent pages allowing

            between screens.

          <typography.BodyMain>
            ‚Ä¢ Shortened the number of steps required to complete certain tasks,
