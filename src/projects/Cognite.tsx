          <typography.Subtitle20>What is Cognite?</typography.Subtitle20>
          <typography.BodyMain>
            Cognite is an enterprise software company that serves customers in
            heavy-asset industries like power & utilities, oil & gas, and
            manufacturing. Their main product offering is Cognite Data Fusion
            (CDF) - software which contextualizes data at scale, enabling
            companies to get access to their data, make sense of it, and then
            use it to make meaningful decisions.
          </typography.BodyMain>
          <typography.Subtitle20>What is AIR?</typography.Subtitle20>
          <typography.BodyMain>
            On top of Cognite Data Fusion sits a handful of business
            applications, one of which is Automatic Identification and
            Reporting, more commonly known as AIR. AIR enables out-of-the-box
            use of data science models to detect and identify abnormal behaviour
            of equipment sensors.

          <br />
          <typography.BodyMain>
            When I joined the team, a proof of concept (POC) for AIR had just
            been completed. This POC was built in 3 months and was used to test
            technical feasibility and to gain some initial insight on customer
            interest. However, as the AIR was only in a POC state, the
            application was incredibly slow and had many usability issues. This
            was because this POC was developed using a lightweight prototyping
            framework with little design considerations.

          <typography.BodyMain>
            As AIR was a new project, we didn‚Äôt have a comprehensive
            understanding of our users and their workflows. The best solution to
            this was to talk to our users face-to-face (even if that meant
            taking a flight{" "}

            Talking to our stakeholders
          </typography.Subtitle20>
          <typography.BodyMain>
            After conducting user research interviews with our end users, we sat
            down with our stakeholders (the manager and VP of our org) to ensure
            that our team was aligned on the definition of success.

          <typography.BodyMain>
            The two primary users of AIR are first line engineers and data
            scientists. To better understand these users, I ran a workshop with
            our team plus a subject matter expert to gain deeper insight. During
            the workshop, we mapped out the pains, gains, and jobs of each user
            persona and then consolidated the main pain points we would focus
            on. From there, persona briefs were created for each primary user,
            which guided the development of more detailed user stories.

            We then looked at Cognite‚Äôs persona library and discussed the scope
            of AIR with the other business application teams that served the
            same personas. Communication across teams is super important to
            identify how our products potentially overlap and how we can
            differentiate. Additionally, these discussions enabled us to
            collaborate on similar infrastructure elements and reusable frontend
            components.
